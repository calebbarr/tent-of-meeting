# Psalm
# 81
# 1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
# 2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
# 3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
# 4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
# 5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
# 6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
# 7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
# 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
# 9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
# 10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
# 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
# 12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
# 13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
# 14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
# 15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
# 16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
Psalm
62
# 1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
# 2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
# 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
# 4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
# 5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
# 6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
# 7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
# 8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
# 9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
# 10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
# 11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
# 12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
Psalm
55
# 1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
# 2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
