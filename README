This project was a real-time, collaborative Bible study and social games app written in Rails and utilizing a Faye push server.
While I am, at times, not proud of the style of the code, the size and scope of this one-person project showcase my versatility as a developer.  If I were to re-do the project, I would probably do it in Node.js (for the current games), or, if intending to add more complex games, Scala's Lift or Play frameworks. Rails was just not a good fit for this project.
